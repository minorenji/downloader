# downloader
A simple python script that reads a text file of download links and uses a Selenium chrome webdriver to download the files sequentially.

I made this when I was modding Skyrim and had to download a lot of mod files and didn't want to do it manually. It's currently meant to only work for the Nexus website with Nexus mod downloaads.
